	<p>My name is Hillary Leyla Bauer, 
	   though I've frequently gone by the
	   name Leyla I. Royale throughout my life. I have an extensive
	   background in lots of fascinating jobs. I've worked as a professional
	   rock cellist, I've been
	   a flying trapeze instructor, and one of my favorite jobs was working
	   as a haunted house clown.</p>
	<p>I'm learning front and back end development to further my career and
	   to help out my peers in one of my favorite industires I've worked in
	   --tourism and history. I've been a professional tour guide in Chicago
	   since 2011 and have researched, written, and led dozens of tours all
	   over the city. While I love research, there are some limitations to 		it,
	   and my goal is to be able to make accessing historical records easier
	   and to create interfaces with which the general public can both find
	   and record their own histories.</p>

<p>The first way I'm looking to do this is by creating a database of the
	   address conversions that happened in Chicago in 1909. That year, the
	   entire city went from its previous addresses to the
	   order we're familliar with today. If you want to figure out the old
	   address of a building, you have to hunt through a PDF scan of
	   a book from 1909 listing every street and its new/old address. My first
	   project as a developer is to create a website in which researchers like
	   myself can simply enter in the new (or old) address to find its
	   partner without having to scan through an old PDF.</p>
	<p>It's a simple idea that requires a lot of data entry, but with fellow
	   historians to help enter addresses, it'll be a site that ultimately
	   saves time for researchers and allows easier access for casual historians
	   to look up the history of a specific building. With skills I'll learn
	   in Python and basic front end development, I'm excited to bring the site
	   to life by the end of the summer.</p>

		I've worked as a tour guide and historian in Chicago since 2011.
		In 2014 I created a site called <strong>Dead in Chicago</strong> that's all 			about weird ways Chicagoans have died. Below are links to my 				favorite stories from the site.
